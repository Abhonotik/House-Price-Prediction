💼 Project: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
🚀 Description:
Built a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression to estimate real estate prices based on key housing features like total living area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas (data analysis)

Scikit-learn (machine learning)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for development)

📊 How It Works:

Loaded and cleaned real estate data from CSV files (train.csv and test.csv)

Trained a regression model on features like GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, and FullBath

Predicted house prices for unseen data (test set)

Exported the predicted results to a CSV file for further use

(Optional) Performed internal validation using train-test split to evaluate model accuracy with metrics like R² Score and Mean Squared Error

💡 Learning Outcome:

Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training

Learned how to deploy and validate ML models using real-world data

Improved understanding of how data-driven predictions work in real estate

📁 The project helped me strengthen my ML fundamentals and get familiar with end-to-end model building and deployment.
